# Introduction
Gulp is a _streaming_ build system that allows you to automate tedious development tasks.

## Difference
The core difference with gulp as compared to Grunt or other build systems is that it is a _streaming_ build system. This removes the need for temporary files and folders and gives you more refined control of how your files flow through the task runner.
