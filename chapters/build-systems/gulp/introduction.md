# Introduction
Gulp is a _streaming_ build system that allows you to automate tedious development tasks.

## Difference
The core difference with gulp as compared to Grunt or other build systems is that it is a _streaming_ build system. This removes the need for temporary files and folders and gives you more refined control of how your files flow through the task runner. Additionally, the file you create to run tasks is code instead of config. If you are familiar with Node.JS or the CommonJS spec, then you will feel right at home when writing your tasks file.
